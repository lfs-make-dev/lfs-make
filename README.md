# LFS-Make

LFS-Make is a build system inspired by Linux From Scratch (LFS) that aims to simplify the process of building custom Linux distributions from source code. It provides a flexible and automated framework for compiling and managing software packages, allowing users to create their personalized Linux systems tailored to their specific needs.

## Overview

The primary goal of LFS-Make is to streamline the construction of Linux systems from scratch, reducing complexity and automating repetitive tasks. By leveraging the power of makefiles and build scripts, LFS-Make simplifies the process of downloading, configuring, compiling, and installing software packages, ensuring a smooth and efficient build experience.

## Features

- **Automated package management**: LFS-Make handles the retrieval, extraction, and configuration of software packages, eliminating the need for manual intervention during the build process.
- **Dependency resolution**: The build system automatically manages dependencies between packages, ensuring that the required software components are installed in the correct order.
- **Customization**: LFS-Make allows users to customize their Linux systems by enabling or disabling specific features, selecting alternative configurations, or adding additional software packages as desired.
- **Error handling**: The build system includes robust error handling mechanisms to detect and report build failures, providing detailed information for troubleshooting and debugging.
- **Incremental builds**: LFS-Make supports incremental builds, allowing users to update and rebuild only the modified packages, significantly reducing build times for subsequent iterations.

## Installation

To install LFS-Make, follow these steps:

1. Clone the LFS-Make repository from GitHub:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lfs-make.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```
   cd lfs-make
   ```

3. Build and install LFS-Make using the provided installation script:

   ```
   ./install.sh
   ```

4. Verify the installation by running the following command:

   ```
   lfs-make --version
   ```

   If successful, the version information should be displayed.

## Usage

To use LFS-Make, follow these steps:

1. Create a new project directory for your Linux From Scratch build:

   ```
   mkdir my-lfs-build
   cd my-lfs-build
   ```

2. Configure your build environment by creating a `lfs-make.conf` file. Refer to the documentation or example configuration files provided for guidance.

3. Customize the list of packages to build by modifying the `lfs-make.packages` file. Uncomment or add the desired package entries.

4. Run the build using the following command:

   ```
   lfs-make
   ```

   LFS-Make will automatically download, configure, build, and install the specified packages, following the defined dependencies and configuration options.

5. After the build completes successfully, you can find the installed files in the output directory specified in the configuration.
